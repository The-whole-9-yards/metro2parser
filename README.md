# metro2parser
A parser for the Metro 2 File Format (see http://www.collect.org/Help/metro2format.html for details), which is used by credit holders to report credit information to the big bureaus.

This is not a complete parser, and is focused on parsing the head and base segments of the fixed length format. It also shows some POJO representation of how that data might notionally be stored after parsing.
